# Program 
* A program is a genral term that refers to a <u>set of instructions</u> designed to perform a specific task or achieve a particular goal. 
* It can be recipe, a chroregraped dance, or a set of rules for a game, etc. 
* Program is a broader concept, <u>not necessarily digitals</u> and they don't have to be. `For examples` : the organization of school party, birthday party, muscial event, etc can be considered programs. 

# Computer Program
* <u>Specific to computer's</u> : A computer program is a set of instructions written within any programming language that execute by the `CPU`(Processor/Multiprocessor) of a computer. It's designed to interact with computer's `hardware` & `software` to calcuate operations **or** perform wide range of tasks. 
* The computer program is written in any programming language and consist of a series of instructions that computers can understand and carry out. These instrctions typically stored as a sequence of binary digits (0 & 1) that computer can interpret and process. 
* A computer program is a list of instrctions to be executed by the `CPU/Processor` of computer, these instrctions in programming language is called statements which tell the computer : `what to do`, `how to do it`, `when to do it`. 
* Computer program are **digital** only and can be executed by the `CPU` of a <u>computer</u> or a <u>device with computing capabilities</u>. 
* A computer program is also called a computer software, which can range from two-lines to million of lines of instructions. 
* ><u>**Use of computer programs**</u> :

# Computer Languages Vs Programming Languages 
* <u>Computer Languages</u> : 
    * The computer language is a language that understood by only computer system is called computer languages(or called as machine language)
    * The computer understand only binary digits whose values consist of series of 0 & 1. 
    * It's means machine language has only two digits 0 and 1.
    * Machine language also knowns as Low-level code, we cannot write any instructions in machine language, because : 
        * It is very compilated 
        * It vary machine to machine
        * Low-level codes are platform dependent (not portable)
    * Computer language is a sequence of low-level instructions, they represent indivisual  actions or operations that `CPU` can perofrm. Instructions are typically represented in binary form, otfen as a sequence of 8 bits(1 byte).
    * `Instrctions` of computer system identify single operation to be performed at a time.
    * Based on low-level code, there 2 types of computer langauges :
        1. Machine codes(Instrctions typically written in the form 0,1 sequence)
        2. Assembly codes(Instrctions typically written in the form of mnemonics)
* <u> Programming Languages</u> :
    * Languages in which we can design programs/software for computer is called as programming languages.
    * Programming languages are closer to devloeprs for easier to write and understand codes.
    * Programming languages provides us a <u>set of statements</u> (High-level abstraction of instrctions) to a computer to execute.
    * Programming is writing set of instrctions for a specific task to be done by computer. 
    * Programming languages are typically high-level languages that abstract away from the complex underlaying hardware details into more understandable & manageable pieace of codes that is easier for developers. 
    * Programming language are sequence of high-level statements, typically consist of multiple instrctions to express more complex logic and algorithms for solving problems during programming.Statements typically consists of operands,operators, keywords in the form of sequence of characters. 
    * `Statements` of programming language can perform multiple operations at a time.
    * Based on high-level code, there are 2 type of programming language : 
        1. Statically typed languages 
        2. Dynamically typed languages
    * <u>Statically Typed Languages</u>: <br>
    Statically typed languages are those in which the <u>`type` of a variable</u> must be declared at the time of its creation and cannot be changed later. C,C++,Java,Go is a statically typed languages.Statically typed languages typically use <u>compiler</u> as translator.
    * <u>Dynamically Typed Languages</u>:<br>
    Dynamically typed languages are those in which the <u>`type` of a variable</u> is not declared at the time of its creation and can be changed later. Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, JavaScript and Ruby.Dynamically typed languages typically use <u>interpreter</u> as translator.



# Types of programming languages : 
    1) High-level (Programming Langauges)
    2) Medium-level (Assembly Language)
    3) Low-level (Machine Language)

    High level languags
    ---------------------
    High level programming language is portable but requires an interpreter or compiler to convert the source code into the machine code. 

    Assembly language
    --------------------
    Assembly language, known as medium level , is not readable by humans. Assemble languages need a translator (compiler/interpreter) to convert the assembler source code into machine code. 

    It is mainly used to code the microprocessors and programming devices at the hardware level. 

    Machine language
    -------------------
    Machine language is a low-level language made up of binary numbers or bits that a computer can understand. 
    It is also known as machine code or object code and is extremely tough to comprehend. 

    This is the only language that the computer understands.

    In the computer, all digital data like (text,numbers,videos, audio, images, etc) are represented in binary form . The CPU processes this machine code or binary data as input. Then, an application or operating system gets the resulting output from the CPU and displays it visually. 

    For example : The ASCII code 01000001 represents the letter “A“ in machine language, hence it is shown on the screen as “A“. 

><u>Program</u> : A set of instructions for computers to follow, written within any programming language.<br>
<u>Programming</u> : Process of developing programs.<br>
<u>Programmer</u> : Person who develops the programs.<br>
<u>Computer Programming language</u> : Programming languages for writting set of instructions.

# Programming Basics 
Any electronic devices/system which are used in computing that : process on data, stores information, transmission data over a network and required the amount of energy power for operations or calcualting on data can be considered as a computer. 

All `electronic decives` work with **DC** (Direct Current) Voltage.These devices ranges from simple calculator to powerful super-computers. 

    Laptops 
    PC
    Smartphones
    Smart-watches 
    Tablet
    Server
    Super-computers
    Embedded Systems 
    IoT Devices 

In order to perform operations on these above mentioned devices or computing devices/systems, we need `computer programs`. And computer program typically written within any programming language (high-level languages) to perform specific operations or managing wide range of tasks( from simple calculations to complex operations like managing <u>databases</u> or <u>creating interactive websites</u> [HTML,CSS,JavaScript] )

The computer programs are special kind of programs typically written in `file`(module), knowns as `program file`. And the file extension of program file must corresponding to the programming language it is written in.This is important for the `compiler/interpreter` to correctly recognize the language and process the code accordingly. 

>While **programs** the `data` and `instructions` are two main aspects, the term `operations` is often used to describe the actions <u>performed by the `instructions/statements`</u> themselves. 

## Data :

* *<u>Definition</u>* : Data is raw_material, unprocessed & unorganized facts and figures without any context, need to be processe by a computer. 
* *<u>Types</u>* : 
    * Numeric data (Integers, Real/Floating-point numbers)
    * Textual data (single character, multiple characters/string)
    * Logic data (true/false)
    * Images
    * Audios
    * Videos
    * And <u>more complex Data Structures</u> : 
        * Array
        * String 
        * Linkedlist
        * Stack 
        * Queue
        * Graph
        * Tree
* *<u>Representations*</u>: Data is stored in memory as a sequence of bits(0 & 1).
* *<u>Stored</u>*: During programming the data are stored in the form of : variables, data-structures, files, DB, objects. 
* *<u>Role</u>* : Data is input & ouput of operations and instructions. 

## Operations : 

*  *<u>Definition*</u> : Actions or Tasks performed by a computer system. 
* *<u>Examples</u> : <br>
    * Arithmetic operations
    * Uniray  operations
    * Relational operations
    * Logical operations
    * Bitwise operations
    * Assignment operations
    * Other operations
* *<u>Relationship</u>* : Operations are fundamentals buidling blocks of instructions.

## Instructions & Statements : 

### Instructions
*<u>Definition*</u> : A sequence of machine-level code  that specifies  a single operations to be performed by the computer.<br>
*<u>Basic Units</u>* : Instrctions are the smallest executable units of a computer program. They  represent indivisual actions or operations that `CPU` can perform.<br>
*<u>Binary Representation</u>* : Instrctions are typically represented in the binary form, often as a sequence of 8 bits(1 byte).<br>
*<u>CPU Execution</u>* : The`CPU`  decodes and executes instrctions one by one, following the sequence spcified in the program.<br>
*<u> For Examples</u>* : <br>

    write program add two numbers.

    1. add two numbers program first written in a file.
    2. program_file load into RAM.
    3. data & instrctions of program_file stored in two different area in RAM.
    4. loading data into register memory.
    5. stroing data in memory.
    6. instrctions are fetched from memory, decoded to determines  the operations and operands (Literal _data/variable) to be executed by the CPU/Processor.
    7. control-flow : branching, looping(jumping to a different location in the program)
    8. finally display the output or saving the result of operations to memory.

### Statements
*<u>Definition</u>* : Statements are often considered <u>high-level abstractions of low-lvel machine code instructions</u>.They represent more complex actions or  concepts in a way that is easier for developer/programmers to understand and write codes during programming. 
*<u>For Exmaples</u>* : A statement like `x = 5;` in Pyhton  is a high-level abstractions that translates to a  series of machine code instrctions that store that value 5 in a memory location associated with the variable 'x'. 

> Statments in programming are the fundamental building blocks that express actions or operations withing a program. They are the units of code that the computer can execute. 

> Statements are often associated with High-level programming langauges offer an abstract way to control complex hardware operations into more understandable and manage
able sets of statements, making programming easier to understand & write codes. This abstraction allows developers to foucs on solving problems & build algorithm logics without worrying about the underlaying hardware details. 

#### <u>Key Points</u> :

High-level programming language are `interface`, typically associated with various statements. Thye server as a bridge between humans and computers, providing a more developer-reable syntax and abstracting away the complexities of machine code. 

**<u>Interfaces</u>** : It means communication between two entities.<br>
**<u>High-level languages</u>** : A programming language designed to be easier for developers to understand and build software/applications by writing set of computers programs.<br>
**<u>Abstraction</u>** : High-level languages hide the low-level details of machine code, allowing programmers to focus on the logic and functionality of their programs.<br>
**<u>Developers-readable syntax</u>** : They use characters (Latters : A to z, Digits : 0 to 9, Other symbols : <,{,(),etc).Each programming language has its own specific syntax for statements. This includes rules for how statements are structured, what elements they can contain, and how they are combined.<br>
**<u>Types</u>** : There are various types of statments, including : 
* Delclaration Statement
* Initialization Statement 
* Assignment Statment 
* Empty Statement 
* Expression Statement 
* Block Statement 
* Data Manipulator Symbols (Operators)
* Input Statement 
* Ouput Statement 
* Slection Statements 
* Iteration Statements
* Jumping Statements
* Functions Definition
* Synchronized/Asynchronized Statement 
* Exception Hanlding Statements 
* File I/O Operations 
* Database Query Statements

**<u>Compiler or Interpreter</u>** : The code written in a high-level language is translated into machine code by a compiler or interpreter, enabling the computer to execute it.<br>

## Program : 
*<u>Definition</u>* : A sequence of instrctions designed to perform a specific operations or managing the wide range of tasks.<br>
*<u>Structure</u>* : Programs can be written in high-level programming languages (Python,C++,Java) or Low-level assembly language.<br>
*<u>Compiler/Interpreter</u>* : A translator in programming is a type of computer program that converts code written in one programming language into another language. The two main types of translators are :<br>

* *<u>Compiler</u>* : Converts the entire source code of a program into machine code (binary code) at once. The resulting machine code can be executed directly by the computer's CPU.<br>
* *<u>Interpreter</u>* : Converts source code into machine code line by line, executing each line immediately. Interpreters do not produce a standalone machine code file; instead, they run the code directly.

Typically high-level languages are use either compiler or interpreter as translator, some mordern languages are use both compiler & interpreter as hybrid approach to speed up the performance. 

## Overviews : 
| Entity | Description  | 
| ------ | ------------ |
| Data   | is raw_material | 
| Operation | are the process |
| Instructions | Are the blueprint for these operations | 
| Programs | Are the combinations of the blueprints and process over data to produce informations.|

For Examples : Login system program

    # data
    stored_username = "user123"
    stored_password = "pass123"


    # instructions
    def login(username, password):
    if username == stored_username and password == stored_password:
        return "Login successful"
    else:
        return "Login failed"


    # output
    print(login("user123", "pass123"))

## Basic Elements Of Programs 

Most of the Human Interface Language (Hindi,English,Spanish,French,etc) are made of several element like : verbs, nouns, adjective, adverbs, perpositions, and conjunction, etc. Simliar to Human Interface Languages, Computer Programming Languages are also made of several elements. These are the basic fundamental elements in the `computer program` which are used in various programming languages to build any kind of operations or software/applications.
