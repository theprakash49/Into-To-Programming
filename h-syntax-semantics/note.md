# Syntax & Semantics

The set of rules that govern the structure and format of a programming language, which are used to write codes/instructions with the help of programming languages. The syntax can vary depending on programming languages. 

Each programming language has its own syntax ( rules for writing code ) and semantics ( meaning of the code ). This helps ensure that the code is readable and maintainable. 

| Syntax | Descriptions |
|--------|--------------|
| string  | Represents textual data, typically written within double quotes |
| number | Represents numeric values, typically written without quotes |
| boolean | Represent logical entity, either true/false |
| void | Absence of data type and often used with functions, specify the function doesn’t return any value to the place where the function was begins called |
| character | Represents single character, the character could be ; letter, digit, any other symbol and typically written within a single quote |
| identation | Refers to white space at the beginning of code-line to indicate block of codes and define the scope of control statements, functions, classes.|
| literals | Represent fixed values/raw data that can be assigned to variables, passing as arguments to functions . Typically it's hard_coded values without getting data from the user/terminal. |
| main( ) | The entry point of a program, where all the statements start execution.|
| ( ) | Represents parentheses, It has different meaning based on different context :=<br>- the context of function definition, it used enclosed parameters.<br>- the context of function call, it used to call a function by passing  with or without  arguments.<br>- the context of expression, it used to define precedence.<br>- the context of control-flow statements, it used to check conditions, returning boolean values either true/false.|
| { } | Represents a pair of curly braces, used to define dictionaries,set data types in context of Python programming. But in the context of c++, javascript it will be different.|
| [ ] | Represents square bracket, it used to define array data type.|
| ; | Represents semicolon, it is used to terminate the statements, also used to separate multiple statements on a single-line. |
| , | Represents comma operator, it used to separate multiple identifiers in variable declaration, also used to make chain statements together inside `for loop`.|
| . | Represents dot operator, it used to separate module_name from classes, functions, variables,etc. Also used to separate variables , methods from a reference_variable and class.|
| # | comment in python context, but in c/c++ context it is an directive |
| Identifers | Identifiers are names, given to an entity in a program, the entity could be ; variableNam, functionName, className, packageName, labelName.|
| Keywords | Keywords are predefined and reserved words , they have a special meaning/purpose to the compiler/interpreter.|
| Comment | The comments are used to explain the codes; about what the code does, how it works.Comments can also be used to prevent the execution, when testing alternative code.|
| Indentation | Indentation refers to the white-space at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in  code is for readability only , the indentation in python is very important. Python uses the indentation to define a block scope / block of code, the block of conditions , loops , functions , classes.|
| In pyhton | Python uses a new line to complete a command , whereas other programming languages use the semicolons (;) to terminate the statement / complete a command.<br><br>By default , in python the end of a statement is marked by a newline character.But we can make the statements extend over multiple lines by using the line continuation character.<br><br>The line continuation character specified into two way : <br>1. Implicitly line continuation → ( ) , [  ] ,  {  }<br>2. explicitly line continuation → \ <br><br>Multiple statement are allowed to one line when separated by semicolons ( ; )
