# Program Terminologies 

Before moving forward, let's understand the various programming terminologies that we use in our day-to-day life : 
|     |     |
|-----|-----|
| Program | Set of instructions for computers to follow, written in any programming language |
| Programming | Process of developing programs |
| Programmer  | Person who develops the programs |
| Programming Language |  computer language for writing set instructions |
| Algorithm | A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task | 
| Variable | Named memory location to store data | 
| Data Types | Representation of different kind of data associated with certain type |
| Function | Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task and can return a value | 
Procedures | Similar to functions but do not return a value | 
| Control-Flow Statements | control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution of a program, such as if-else, else-if , loops statements |
| Syntax | The set of rules that govern the structure and format of a programming language |
| Comment | A piece of text in a program that is ignored by the compiler or interpreter, used to add notes or explanations to the code | 
| Debugging | The process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program | 
| IDE | Integrated Development Environment, a software application that provides a comprehensive development environment for coding, debugging, and testing | 
| Operator | Special symbols used to perform operations on operands, typically used to manipulate data of variables or literal values |
| Statement | A single line or instruction in a program that performs a specific action or operation |
| oop | OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects that represent real-world entities. These objects can have attributes (variables) and behaviors (functions). OOP languages, such as C++, allow for the creation of classes, which are templates for objects | 
| Statically Typed | Statically typed languages are those in which the type of a variable must be declared at the time of its creation and cannot be changed later. C++ is a statically typed language | 
| Dynamically Typed | Dynamically typed languages are those in which the type of a variable is not declared at the time of its creation and can be changed later. Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python , JavaScript and Ruby | 
| Header Files | Header files in C++ are files that contain declarations for functions, variables, and other constructs that can be included in a C++ program using the preprocessor directive "#include". These declarations allow the program to use the functions and variables defined in the header file without having to know their implementation details |
| Namespace | A namespace in C++ is a container for a set of identifiers (variables, functions, etc.) that helps to prevent naming conflicts in large programs. Namespaces are declared using the "namespace" keyword and can be referenced using the "::" operator | 
| Strongly Typed Language | In a strongly typed language, the data type of a variable is enforced at compile-time. This means that the compiler checks for type compatibility and raises an error if there's a type mismatch.Strongly typed languages provide more safety and prevent many common programming errors related to data type mismatches|
Weakly Typed Language | In a weakly typed language, the data type of a variable can be changed implicitly during runtime. Type conversions may happen automatically without explicit instructions from the programmer. Weakly typed languages offer more flexibility but can lead to unexpected behavior and errors if type conversions are not handled carefully |
| Development Tools | Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software applications that provide comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Eclipse).<br><br> `Compilers and Interpreters` : Programs that translate code from high-level programming languages to machine code | 
| Debugging & Testing | Debugging : The process of finding and fixing errors in the code.<br><br>Testing : Verifying that the code works as expected (unit testing, integration testing) |
| Translator | A translator in programming is a type of computer program that converts code written in one programming language into another language. The two main types of translators are :<br><br>Compiler: Converts the entire source code of a program into machine code (binary code) at once. The resulting machine code can be executed directly by the computer's CPU.<br><br>Interpreter: Converts source code into machine code line by line, executing each line immediately. Interpreters do not produce a standalone machine code file; instead, they run the code directly.|
| Preprocessor | A preprocessor is a tool that processes the source code before it is passed to the compiler.<br><br>It performs several tasks such as:<br><br><u>Macro Expansion</u>: Replaces macros with their corresponding values or code.<br><u>File Inclusion</u> : Handles the inclusion of other files (e.g., header files in C/C++).<br><u>Conditional Compilation</u> : Compiles certain parts of the code based on specified conditions.<br><u>Line Control</u> : Provides information about the original source code line numbers, which helps in debugging.<br><br>In C and C++, the preprocessor directives start with a # symbol (e.g., #include, #define, #if).|
| Linker | A linker is a tool that combines multiple object files (generated by the compiler) into a single executable file or library. The linker performs several important tasks:<br><br>1. <u>Symbol Resolution</u> : Resolves references to undefined symbols by linking them to their definitions.<br>2. <u>Address Binding</u> : Assigns memory addresses to various parts of the program, such as code, data, and stack.<br>3. <u>Library Linking</u> : Integrates external libraries into the executable.<br>4. <u>Relocation</u> : Adjusts the addresses in the object code to reflect the actual memory locations where the code will reside.<br><br>The linker ensures that all parts of the program are correctly connected and that the final executable can run as intended.|
| Loader | It is a special program that takes input of executable files from linker, loads it to main memory, and prepares this code for execution by computer. Loader allocates memory space to program. Even it settles down symbolic references between objects. It is in charge of loading programs and libraries in the operating system. The embedded computer systems don’t have loaders. In them, code is executed through ROM.<br><br>There are following various loading schemes :<br>1. Absolute Loaders<br>2. Relocating Loaders<br>3. Direct Linking Loaders<br>4. Bootstrap Loaders<br><br>The loader performs several tasks, including :<br><br>1. <u>Loading</u> : The loader loads the executable file into memory and allocates memory for the program.<br>2. <u>Relocation</u> : The loader adjusts the program’s memory addresses to reflect its location in memory.<br>3. <u>Symbol resolution</u> : The loader resolves any unresolved external symbols that are required by the program.<br>4. <u>Dynamic linking</u> : The loader can dynamically link libraries into the program at runtime to provide additional functionality.|
| Data Structures | Organized ways to store and manage data, such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables, providing different ways to access and manipulate the data .<br>Organized collections of data elements.<br>Provide efficient ways to store, access, and manipulate related data.<br><br>Various types with specific strengths : <br><br> → Arrays : Fixed-size, contiguous memory locations for similar data types.<br> → LinkedLists : Dynamic collections where elements are linked by references.<br> → Stacks : LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order, useful for function calls and undo/redo operations.<br> → Queues : FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order, used for task scheduling and message passing.<br> → Trees : Hierarchical structures for efficient searching and sorting.<br> → Graphs : Represent relationships between data points.|
| Files | Persistent storage on a disk, allowing data to be saved and accessed across different runs of the program. <br><br>Store data on a permanent storage device (hard disk, SSD).<br>Accessed through file I/O operations (reading, writing, appending).<br><br>Suitable for :<br><br> → Long-term data persistence.<br> → Large datasets that don't fit easily in memory.<br> → Sharing data between programs or across program executions.<br> → Suitable for larger datasets or data that needs to be shared across programs.<br> → Various file formats for different data types (text, images, audio, etc.)|
