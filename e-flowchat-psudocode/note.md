<u>Flowchart</u> : 
* Diagrams of solution.
* <u>Componets of Flow-chart</u>: 
    1. Oval-Shape : Indicates start or end of program-flow 
    2. Parallelogram-Shape : input or ouput of information
    3. Reactable-Shape : refer to any process or actions step to be carried out
    4. Diamond-Shape : Indicates decision point between two or more path
    5. Arrow Symbol : Indicate the direction in program 

<u>Pseudo code</u> :
* Generally logic of solution.
* Pseudo code refers to middle part between `logic` and `code-implementation`.
* <u>step</u> : 
    1. start
    2. input a & b
    3. sum = a + b
    4. print sum 
    5. exit
